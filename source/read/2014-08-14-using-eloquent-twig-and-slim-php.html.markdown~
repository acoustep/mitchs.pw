[Using Eloquent, Twig and Slim PHP][]
-------------------------------------

*Published on August 07, 2013*

Originally while I was writing this blog I intended to make a step by
step guide to putting together three of my favourite PHP tools. After a
few issues and finding out that [Slim Views][] is now a thing I decided
instead to put together a git repo so anyone can get started quickly. I
will use this blog post to quickly show how it works!

*Note that this tutorial doesn’t aim to teach you Slim, Twig or Eloquent
- It’s to show you how to use them together effectively.*

You can find the repo here:
<https://github.com/acoustep/slim-twig-eloquent>

After following the Installation instructions you should be able to use
each component as well as Eloquent validation.
