As quoted from their website, Middleman is "A static site generator using all the shortcuts and tools in modern web development".

I really love using Middleman for simple static websites.  Everything I use in my front end stack (SASS and coffeescript) just works out of the box.

Using two commands ```middleman``` while developing a website locally and then ```middleman build``` when I'm ready to push the static content to my server. It really saves a lot of time.

Anyway to the point of this blog post.  One of the features of Middleman is the ability to load ready made templates so you don't have to waste time setting up layouts.

I have written a small template for Middleman that sets up Bootstrap 3 with the Slim templating engine (My preference to HTML).  This also uses Bower for javascript dependancies (You will need Node and NPM installed for this).

You can view it / download it from my github repo [available here](https://github.com/acoustep/middleman-bootstrap3-sass-slim).
