		<p><em>Posted on Aug 23, 2015</em></p>
		<p>So, I&rsquo;ve taken to learning RubyMotion specifically to make iOS applications.  This blog is all about my experience as a fresh iOS developer with no prior experience with Objective C or Swift.  I&rsquo;ll go through the benefits, the bottlenecks and what I intend to do in the future.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of my App. It&rsquo;s a very simple guitar tuner called Tune Fork. For anyone that doesn&rsquo;t play guitar, the strings occasionally need tuning and some songs need playing in different tunings, too.  This app&rsquo;s purpose is to make tuning easier. It&rsquo;s certainly not a unique app. Similar apps exist, but I felt it was a reasonably simple app to make for my skill level.</p>

<p><img class="gfyitem" data-id="NiftyCreativeDutchsmoushond" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;"/></p>

<p>There are 3 tabs: </p>

<ul>
<li>The tuner, which plays the notes out loud</li>
<li>The profiles tab, which lets you select or create custom tunings.</li>
<li>The settings tab, which adds some minor customisations to the tuner.</li>
</ul>

<p>RubyMotion is comparable to Ruby, with the added project generator and various rake tasks for compiling and testing out of the box.  These are useful, but I had no prior experience with iOS development and I spent most of my time reading books and watching screencasts on how to use it.</p>

<p>I really wish that RubyMotion came with <em>more</em> documentation and <em>more</em> handholding for beginners. The getting started guide consists of basic terminology, installation, a list of recommended text editors and a &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; application for iOS and OSX. I appreciate that there are a lot of samples but for a paid programming language I expect more documentation.</p>

<p><a href="http://motioninmotion.tv">MotionInMotion</a> has some incredible screencasts that really made RubyMotion click for me, especially the RubyMotion for Rails Developers series. It&rsquo;s disappointing that FluffyJack seems to have stopped making them. Considering it costs $9/month and boasts a &ldquo;New Episode Every Monday&rdquo; - as of now (August 22nd, 2015) there hasn&rsquo;t been a screen cast since April 7th. That&rsquo;s a lot of missed Mondays! His book, RubyMotion for Rails Developers, which I preordered, also appears to be abandoned, with no sign of updates since the initial sample chapter.</p>

<p><a href="http://motion-toolbox.com/">Motion Toolbox</a> is a simple website that helps you find gems. It leaves a lot to be desired if, like me, you don&rsquo;t really know what you&rsquo;re looking for. Categories are cool and all but having a text search like <a href="https://rubygems.org">RubyGems</a>, <a href="https://packagist.org/">NPM</a> or <a href="https://packagist.org/">Packagist</a> would be more useful.</p>

<p>There are a lot of gems out there that try to hide the cruft of Objective C which leaks through to RubyMotion. ProMotion, MotionKit, Sugarcube, RMQ, Bubblewrap, MotionPrime&hellip; the list goes on.  You would think that this is a good thing; however, as a beginner it&rsquo;s quite overwhelming. Some of these gems have overlapping responsibilities it&rsquo;s difficult to know which combinations to use.</p>

<p>The RedPotion gem makes this a non-issue. RedPotion glues a few of these gems together.  Namely, ProMotion and RMQ, as well as other useful gems. It has detailed documentation to get you started. It also comes with a lot of useful generators and a sensible directory structure. It&rsquo;s essentially Rails for  RubyMotion.</p>

<p>If RedPotion is Rails then RMQ is jQuery. As quoted from their Github, &ldquo;fast, non-polluting, chaining, front-end library. Itâ€™s like jQuery for RubyMotion plus templates, stylesheets, events, animations, etc.&rdquo;.  My favourite feature of this gem is the live stylesheet reloading which allows editing the styles without recompiling the application - a huge time saver!</p>

<p>With the documentation from all of the gems that RedPotion brings you can get a surprising amount of work done. Problems arise when you want to steer away from the happy path, though. For example I wanted to change a significant amount of the colour scheme of my app and with certain elements it can be very awkward.  Along side a lot of Googling, <a href="http://revealapp.com">Reveal</a> and the Sublime Text Plugin <a href="https://github.com/kyamaguchi/SublimeObjC2RubyMotion">SublimeObjC2RubyMotion</a> have been incredibly useful.</p>

<p>The majority of problems can be solved with Google but it&rsquo;s very rare to see an answer in RubyMotion. It&rsquo;s a shame, but I don&rsquo;t feel pretending Objective C or Swift don&rsquo;t exist is a viable option. I may end up reading one or two books on iOS development in Swift in the future, as I believe it would be hugely beneficial. I fear there will never be a time when I can Google a question and assume that the answer is already available in RM.</p>

<p>In terms of community RubyMotion has the disadvantage of the added cost. This steers a significant amount of people away from RM but the people that <em>are</em> there are very helpful and fast to respond to any questions. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to see a way to encourage programmers from other CLI driven languages to pursue RubyMotion. Node, [Modern] PHP, Python developers etc. As far as I&rsquo;m aware there is no alternative in those languages. Although they may not know Ruby they still might enjoy the workflow that RubyMotion and RedPotion bring.</p>

<p>In summary, RubyMotion is far from perfect, but if you prefer the &ldquo;webdev&rdquo; workflow of CLI generators, REPL and using your preferred text editor I think it&rsquo;s worth a shot - especially with the RedPotion gem. Aside from a few hiccups, it&rsquo;s quite enjoyable to use. I know that I would never have made my first app if RubyMotion and RedPotion didn&rsquo;t exist so I&rsquo;m quite pleased that I gave it a go.</p>
